  <h3>Prompt for March 4</h3>
  <p>
    Each student: Get a note card.<p/>
  <ul><li>On the FRONT, write your name, netid, and the best feedback you got on your project.</li>

  <p> <span style="font-weight:bold;">I have also added one additional requirement to the final Project 1 write-up:</span> <br/>
    At the end of your PDF file, also include an outline of team contributions to the project. Identify how work was broken down in the group and explain each group member's contributions to the project. Give a rough breakdown of how much time you spent developing and which parts of the project took the most time.<br/>
