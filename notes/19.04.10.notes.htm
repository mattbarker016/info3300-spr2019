    <li>On the BACK, for three projects, write a short description of the project and feedback that you provided.</li>
  <li>Don't forget to turn your card into the bins by the doors or the lecturn at the front by the end of class!</li></ul>

  <h3>Instructions for demos</h3>
  <p>Groups will present in one of FIVE phases, ~20 groups per phase.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>When you are presenting, <strong>present your prototype at your indicated location either in front or along the ledge at the back</strong>.</li>
    <li>When you are NOT presenting, circulate among the projects and provide feedback.</li>
    <li>If you need a break to write on your card, find a seat and stay out of the aisles.</li>
